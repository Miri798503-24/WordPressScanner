Recommendations:
1. Remove Unnecessary Files:
   - Delete any old or unused files.
2. Restrict Access:
   - Configure the web server to prevent access to sensitive files.
3. Set Proper Permissions:
   - Ensure sensitive files have restrictive permissions.
4. Disable Directory Listing:
   - Prevent directory contents from being listed.
5. Implement Access Controls:
   - Use authentication and IP whitelisting to restrict access.
6. Secure Backups:
   - Store backups securely and ensure they are not web-accessible.
7. Environment Segregation:
   - Keep development and production environments separate.
8. Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF):
   - Deploy a WAF to block attempts to access sensitive files.
